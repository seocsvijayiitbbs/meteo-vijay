# Being Fluidic with Climate Science!

I am Vijay Vishwakarma, a passionate person to learn and relearn, an enthusiatic and motivated research scholar in the School of Earth Ocean and Climate Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Bhubaneshwar.

Here, I am starting with a vision to create editable and mangaeable programming codes to analyse Climate Science datasets. I am pretty sure about a beatiful that we all have been bestowed by the supreme Creator, rather I will feel fortunate enough if my codes will be of any help for your problems.

Cheers!
