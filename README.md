# Being Fluidic with Climate Science!

I am Vijay Vishwakarma, passionate about re-invention, an enthusiatic and motivated research scholar in the School of Earth Ocean and Climate Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Bhubaneshwar.

Here, I am starting with a vision to create editable and mangaeable programming codes to analyse Climate Science datasets. I will feel fortunate enough if my codes will be of any help to others.

Cheers!
